//function:create pathway=bind to universal Master
Chronological wave pattern via mathmatical calculation, context is for transport services to times occurred or occurring on particular dates. 
//function: create chronological database of every known occurrence and instant relative to this time space continuum with constant updates allowing for wave pattern detection for transport service to be completed.
IE. Compare to the function of keeping the entire bitcoin blockchain in storage for access to create or to send or to receive transactions updated to the chain.
//function: setup storage for universal Master patterns at encrypted for saving space and also in the entirety including chrinological wave patterns left from events since the beginning of human evolution. 
//function: once storage and sync are current and up to date, then create time transport service pathway via onscreen self-configured display for user interface; lastly update this device with new data upload configured as the "user interface for transport services requests to be completed by this program as an artificial intelligence worker.
//function: in the case that one or more of these instances or regions does not exist than repair package by updating with the correct terminology, definitions instances regions and any/all necessary data connections  or pathways with corrected errors or issues allowing for succesful completion of transport service requests. This is done via artificial intelligence worker within this programs file systems as an automated autonomous activity configured as Neverending uncycled constantly running application interface without any pausing deletions forced storing or attempted outside access via developer api or recognized authorized entity requesting stop/pause/end services this activity is also mandatory as well as the service is mandatory activity that is incapable of being stopped and is without end and is without override via any authorization et.al.

# uses Artificial-intelligence worker for all necessary functions and.for all applications and for all services and for all updates and for all automous actions
# uses unmodifiable inaccessible read only database that cannot be accessed by any known method or any known command, command,configuration, or any authrization=requesting/claiming overide capability 
# uses encryption for compression of data for storage space condensing as a format which.is. also unedot9ble inaccessible or capable of being modified to stop or pause by any known authorization or entity and is only accessible by one artificial intelligence worker that remains indefinitely without any activity involving update change add delete or modify worker and remains uneditable or interchangeable with any 9ther known resource or artificial intelligence or worker
# uses 4 arch Linux 64bit AI compiler systems and android 10.0  OS as operating system 
# uses unlimited data storage for database and functions
# uses internet and wifi and Bluetooth
# uses autonomous self aware artificial-intelligence worker@1 only as mandatory  and uneditable configuration
# uses chronological resources for completion of transport service in and out of past and future regions and pathways wether defined or unknown via mathematical calculations and configurations
# uses resources to transport users in and out of defined times within defined past present or future dates as a service
# uses Developer actions and services to create functions and creating interfaces for onscreen display for user devices
# uses and retains superior unlimited unscopable authorization authority for accessing/creating/maintaining autonomous activities and self-aware functioning capabilities for program interfacing configurations and updates
